# SANDBOX - Docker Compose Test Suite

This project sets up a test suite using Docker Compose, which includes three containers: an OAuth2 Proxy, a Whoami application, and an Nginx proxy. The Nginx proxy serves two endpoints: one for public access and another for private access that requires authentication via the OAuth2 Proxy and a Keycloak identity provider.

## Project Structure

```
docker-compose-test-suite
├── docker-compose.yml        # Defines the services for the Docker Compose application
├── nginx.conf
└── README.md                 # Documentation for the project
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

### Building the Containers

To build the containers, navigate to the project directory and run:

```
docker-compose build
```

### Running the Application

Make sure that you have created a **.env** file with the essential OIDC Provider and Domain details of your installation. For that you can copy the provided **.env.sample**:

```
cp .env.sample .env
```

And now edit **.env** that matches your situation

To start the application, use the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start all the defined services. You can access the public endpoint at `http://localhost:80` and the private endpoint at `http://localhost:80/private`.

### Configuration Details

- **Nginx**: `nginx.conf` requests to the Whoami application and handles authentication for the private endpoint.
- **Whoami Application**: A simple HTTP server that responds with details about the incoming request.

### Stopping the Application

To stop the application, run:

```
docker-compose down
```

This will stop and remove all the containers defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.
